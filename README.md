# 🏧ATM (Automated Teller Machine)

<h4>🧑‍💼ATM Management System (Beginner Friendly).</h4>

  An ATM Management System is like a smart machine that helps people do money stuff at banks without needing to
  talk to a person. You can take out cash or check how much money you have, and you don't need a person like a cashier to help you. It's all done 
  electronically.
